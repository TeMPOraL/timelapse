* Timelapse

** About
A simple PHP script that takes screenshots in regular time intervals.

Inspired by Ludum Dare, [[http://code.google.com/p/chronolapse/][ChronoLapse]] and [[http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/04/23/linux-desktop-time-lapse-creation-script/][Linux Desktop Time-lapse Creation Script by winferno]].

** Usage
 - ./timelapse start [interval] [offset] - starts timelapse script with given interval in seconds (default: 10).
   'offset' parameter sets the initial frame name. By specifying it, you can continue a recording that was previously
   interrupted.
 - ./timelapse compile - compiles all screenshots in current directory to a movie. It starts from 0000.jpg.
 - ./timelapse clean - removes all .jpg files from current directory

** Required tools
 - php
 - scrot
 - ImageMagick
 - ffmpeg

** Troubleshooting
If for some reason typing ./timelapse [args] fails to execute the script, try: php timelapse [args].
